# 1143. Longest Common Subsequence
Question link is [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-subsequence/).

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return `true` if it is possible to divide this array into `k` non-empty subsets whose sums are all equal.

Given two strings `text1` and `text2`, return *the length of their longest **common subsequence**.* If there is no **common subsequence**, return `0`.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

- For example, `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"`.

A **common subsequence** of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" 
Output: 3  
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.
```

### Solution

Too busy to write solution idea, just post solution.

```java
class Solution {
    public int longestCommonSubsequence(String text1, String text2) {
        int n = text1.length(), m =  text2.length();
        int[][] f = new int[n + 1][m + 1];
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= m; ++j) {
                if (text1.charAt(i - 1) == text2.charAt(j - 1)) {
                    f[i][j] = f[i - 1][j - 1] + 1;
                } else {
                    f[i][j] = Math.max(f[i - 1][j], f[i][j - 1]);
                }
            }
        }
        return f[n][m];
    }
}
```
