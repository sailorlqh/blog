# Biweekly Contest 63

Question link is [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-with-cooldown/).

### Leetcode 2037

[2037. Minimum Number of Moves to Seat Every](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-moves-to-seat-everyone)

```python
class Solution:
    def minMovesToSeat(self, seats: List[int], students: List[int]) -> int:
        seats.sort()
        students.sort()
        res = 0
        for i in range(len(seats)):
            res += abs(students[i] - seats[i])
        return res
        
```

### Leetcode 2038

[2038. Remove Colored Pieces if Both Neighbors](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-colored-pieces-if-both-neighbors-are-the-same-color)

```python
class Solution:
    def winnerOfGame(self, colors: str) -> bool:
        alice = 0
        bob = 0
        for i in range(len(colors) - 2):
            if colors[i:i+3] == 'AAA':
                alice += 1
            if colors[i:i+3] == 'BBB':
                bob += 1
        if alice <= bob:
            return False
        else:
            return True
        
```



### Leetcode 2039

[2039. The Time When the Network Becomes Idle](https://leetcode.com/problems/the-time-when-the-network-becomes-idle)

First build graph, and calculate the distance d between each node to  node[0], the time for the first reply to arrive is 2d. And the delay time if $2d - 2d \% patience$, special case is when $2d\%patience=0$, in this case, when the node receive the reply message, it won't send out a new message, so the delay for the last message is $2d -patience$. And the delay time is the time for the last message to arrive at node, there would be one more second for the whole area to become idle.

```python
class Solution:
    def networkBecomesIdle(self, edges, patience) -> int:
        connected = {}
        dist = {}
        for i in range(len(patience)):
            connected[i] = []
            dist[(i, 0)] = 10 ** 9
        for src, dest in edges:
            connected[src].append(dest)
            connected[dest].append(src)
        dist[(0, 0)] = 0
        stack = []
        for element in connected[0]:
            stack.append(element)
        cnt = 1
        stack.append(None)
        visited = set()
        visited.add(0)
        flag = False
        while len(stack) > 0:
            node = stack.pop(0)
            if node is None:
                if flag is True:
                    break
                stack.append(None)
                flag = True
                cnt += 1
                continue
            flag = False
            if node in visited:
                continue
            visited.add(node)
            dist[(node, 0)] = min(cnt, dist[(node, 0)])
            for element in connected[node]:
                if element not in visited:
                    stack.append(element)
        res = 0
        for i in range(1, len(patience)):
            time = dist[(i, 0)] * 2
            res = max(time + 1, res)
            if time > patience[i]:
                delay = time % patience[i]
                if delay == 0:
                    delay += patience[i]
                total = time + time - delay + 1
                res = max(res, total)
        return res
```



### Leetcode 2040

[2040. Kth Smallest Product of Two Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-product-of-two-sorted-arrays)

Didn't finish during contest, this is the reference of Leetcode User: [lee215](https://leetcode.com/lee215/)

```python
class Solution:
   def kthSmallestProduct(self, A, B, k):
        n, m = len(A), len(B)
        A1,A2 = [-a for a in A if a < 0][::-1], [a for a in A if a >= 0]
        B1,B2 = [-a for a in B if a < 0][::-1], [a for a in B if a >= 0]

        neg = len(A1) * len(B2) + len(A2) * len(B1)
        if k > neg:
            k -= neg
            s = 1
        else:
            k = neg - k + 1
            B1, B2 = B2,B1
            s = -1

        def count(A, B, x):
            res = 0
            j = len(B) - 1
            for i in xrange(len(A)):
                while j >= 0 and A[i] * B[j] > x:
                    j -= 1
                res += j + 1
            return res

        left, right = 0, 10**10
        while left < right:
            mid = (left + right) / 2
            if count(A1, B1, mid) + count(A2, B2, mid) >= k:
                right = mid
            else:
                left = mid + 1
        return left * s
