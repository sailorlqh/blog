# 115. Distinct Subsequences
Question Link is [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/distinct-subsequences/).

I am too busy today, so I will just post this solution and update is tomorrow.

```
class Solution:
    def numDistinct(self, s: str, t: str) -> int:
        dp = [[0] * (len(t)+1) for _ in range(len(s)+1)]
        for i in range(len(s)):
            dp[i][0] = 1
        for j in range(1, len(t)):
            dp[0][j] = 0
        for i in range(1, len(s)+1):
            for j in range(1, len(t)+1):
                if s[i-1] == t[j-1]:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + dp[i-1][j]
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]
        return dp[-1][-1]

```
