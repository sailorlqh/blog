# 116. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node
Question Link is [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/populating-next-right-pointers-in-each-node/).

There are two solutions for this problem. 

#### Solution 1

The first one is quiet obvious, we can use BFS to traverse each level of the tree. And during the traverse of one level, we can point the current node to the next node in line. And after finishing traverse the current level, we can traverse the next level, until no node is left. So here's the code.

```python
class Solution:
    def connect(self, root: 'Node') -> 'Node':
        if root == None:
            return root
        cur = [root]
        while len(cur) != 0:
            temp = cur
            cur = []
            while len(temp) != 0:
                node = temp.pop(0)
                node.next = temp[0] if len(temp) != 0 else None
                if node.left != None:
                    cur.append(node.left)
                if node.right != None:
                    cur.append(node.right)
        return root
        
```

#### Solution 2

As for solution 2, we can take advange of the next pointer of each node and the hierarchy of the tree. 

We can find that node.left.next = node.right and node.right.next = node.next.left. The difference between solution 2 and solution 1 is that in solution one, as we travel through the current level, we only mark the nodes is the current level, while in solution 2, we mark the next points for the next level. And here's the node.

```python
class Solution:
    def connect(self, root: 'Node') -> 'Node':
        if root == None:
            return root
        cur = root
        while cur.left is not None:
            node = cur
            while node is not None:
                node.left.next = node.right
                node.right.next = node.next.left if node.next is not None else None
                node = node.next
            cur = cur.left
        return root
```
