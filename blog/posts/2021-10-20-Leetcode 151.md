# 151. Reverse Words in a String

Question link is [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string/).

### Question

Given an input string `s`, reverse the order of the **words**.

A **word** is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The **words** in `s` will be separated by at least one space.

Return *a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.*

**Note** that `s` may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "the sky is blue"
Output: "blue is sky the"
```

### Solution

Using reg expression with build in split function makes this question really easy.

```python
class Solution:
    def reverseWords(self, s: str) -> str:
        return " ".join(re.split("\s+", s.strip())[::-1])
```
